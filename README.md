# amal-profile
Made my first website as developer. It was very helpful to see a sort of real-life sample instead of those simplified versions for beginners!

First I wrote the HTML code to define the structure and contents of my web page – where things go, how they are laid out, and what’s on the page. Then I wrote  the CSS/SASS  to define the styling of a web page and the elements on it. At the end, I made it responsive website that will work on all devices, PC, laptop, tablet, and phone.
	
TABLE OF CONTENTS: SKILLS I NEEDED TO DESIGN AND DEVELOP MY WEBPAGE:


*	HTML/CSS
*	JavaScript
*	Testing/Debugging:
*	Git/Version Control

HTML Layout Techniques:
There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:
*	CSS framework
*	CSS float property
*	CSS flexbox
*	CSS grid


### I used :
1-  CSS Flexbox Layout that ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
2- CSS Grid Layout that offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
