# JavaScript Arrays 
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

const fruits = ["Mango", "Apple", "Orange"];

## Why Use Arrays?
However,  if we want to loop through the Grades and find a specific one,
for example : if we have 300 grades

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and we can access the values by referring to an index number.

## Accessing Array Elements
You access an array element by referring to the  **index number:**

```
let grad=grades[0];
let grad=grades[105];
```

## The length Property

The **length property** of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).
 ### Example :
 ```
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let length = fruits.length;
```
