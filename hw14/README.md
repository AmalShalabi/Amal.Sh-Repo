# I Solve This Exercise By :

## 1- Accessing Array Elements
I access an array element by referring to the  **index number:**

```
let grade=grades[0];
let grade=grades[105];
```

## 2- The length Property

The **length property** of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).
 ### Example :
 ```
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let length = fruits.length;
```

## 3- Looping Array Elements
For example , to loop through an array, is using a for loop:

```
const Names = ["Amal", "Maya", "Jumana"];
let fLen = fruits.length;

let text = " ";
for (let i = 0; i < fLen; i++) {
  text += fruits[i] + "<br>";
}
document.write(" The Names that the most I  like Are: " +  text);
```
