# JavaScript Arrays 
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

const fruits = ["Mango", "Apple", "Orange"];

## Why Use Arrays?
However, what if you want to loop through the Grades and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 Grades, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

## Accessing Array Elements
You access an array element by referring to the  **index number:**
let grad=grades[0]

Note: Array indexes start with 0.

[0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.

## The length Property
The **length property** of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).
 ### Example :
 ```
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let length = fruits.length;
```
