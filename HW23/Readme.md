# HW No.23 
# Exercise about jQuery 

## Assignment Contains :
* HTML file
* CSS file
* JavaScript
* jQuery / a JavaScript Library.

Here we've been asked to append "input" fields to "option" according to the number of the both "input" fields value.

## jQuery Syntax
Basic syntax is: 
```js
$(selector).action()
```
##  All jQuery methods are inside a document ready event:

```js
$(document).ready(function(){

  // jQuery methods go here...

});
```
This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).
