# HW NO. 19
### The solution of this task includes:

* HTML to define the structure and semantics of the content
* Dom Practice:When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.
  The document object is the root node of the HTML document. 
  The document object is a property of the window object. 

  The document object is accessed with:
  ```
  document.
  ```
  for example :
  ```
  document.createElement()	;
  document.getElementById()	;
  ```
  ##And Many More Document Object Properties

* CSS to style it and lay it out. For example, I use CSS to  color, size, and spacing of my content or add animations and other decorative features. Indeed I enjoyed It !!
