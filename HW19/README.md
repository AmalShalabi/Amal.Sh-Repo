# HW NO. 19
### The solution of this task includes:

* HTML: to define the structure and semantics of the content
* DOM: Practice:When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.
  
  The document object is accessed with:
  ```
  document.
  ```
  For example :
  ```
  document.createElement()	;
  document.getElementById()	;
  ```
  ## And Many More Document Object Properties..

* CSS to style my webpag and lay it out. For example, I use CSS to  color, size, and spacing of my content , added animations and other decorative features. Indeed I enjoyed It !!
