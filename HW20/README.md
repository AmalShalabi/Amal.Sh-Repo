# HW NO. 20

In this task ,my code contains: :

* ### localStorage:
 The localStorage read-only property of the window interface which allows the user to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.

* ### Sass file :
 I acttully always prefer to style with Sass,which boasts more features and abilities than CSS : like the use of logic statements , integration with other libraries like Compas, and many more. These features alone can help to be more productive and to write better CSS in the end.
